# Wireless-User-Presence-Prediction-using-Pattern-Recognition
Given a Wireless Localization Dataset, this project aims to utilize some of the various classification algorithms used in Pattern Recognition, namely, Stochastic Gradient Descent Approach(Batch), Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Classifier(Naïve Bayes Classifier), k-NN(k Nearest Neighbors) Classifier, Perceptron Classifier and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Approach.

In this project, above mentioned techniques are used to implement classification of data to predict the availability of a user in a room out of the four available classes (denoting the rooms). Naïve Bayes Classifier is used as the baseline for performance analysis and comparison with other classifiers as implemented.
